# PasswordGenerator
<strong>Hello World</strong> here is a project that as the name states will create random password 8 to 128 characters long.

It's very simplified but can be build upon to make it more efficient and streamlined.

<h2>How it works</h2>

User loads page, then clicks generate button, and
in turn user will be prompted to input a number from 8-128.<br>

after user will be asked to confirm if numbers, symbols, UpperCase Letters, and/or LowerCase letters will be used for their unique password.<br>

This version uses confirm box to get essentially a yes or no from the user.<br>

Future versions will use different methods to get the users input.
